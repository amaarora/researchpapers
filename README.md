# researchpapers
Inspired by Andrew Ng's advice on [how to do research](https://youtu.be/733m6qBH-jI?t=201), I have decided to keep a master list of research papers (related to Computer Vision) that are either on my reading list or I have read so far.

| Research Paper                                                                       | URL                              | Progress (*/10) |
